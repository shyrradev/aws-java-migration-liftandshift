## Project Overview

This project involves the migration of a Java application to AWS using a lift-and-shift approach. The architecture leverages various AWS services to ensure high availability, scalability, and robust performance. The architecture includes an application load balancer, auto-scaling groups, and backend services hosted within a virtual private cloud (VPC).

## Components

### Users

- **End Users**: Represented as clients interacting with the application through the internet. They access the application via HTTPS, ensuring secure communication.

### VPC and Subnets

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: The entire architecture is hosted within a VPC, providing network isolation and security.
    
- **Public Subnet**:
    
    - Contains resources that need to be accessible from the internet, such as the load balancer.
- **Private Subnet**:
    
    - Houses backend services that do not require direct internet access, enhancing security.

### Load Balancer

- **Application Load Balancer (ELB)**:
    - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple Tomcat instances. It provides fault tolerance and ensures high availability by rerouting traffic in case of instance failures.

### Tomcat Instances

- **Tomcat Instances**:
    - Deployed in an auto-scaling group across multiple availability zones (AZs) to handle varying loads efficiently. Instances are configured to scale out or in based on demand.

### Backend Services

- **Memcached**:
    - Used as an in-memory key-value store to cache frequently accessed data, reducing latency for user requests.
- **MySQL**:
    - A relational database management system configured in a multi-AZ deployment for high availability and data durability.
- **RabbitMQ**:
    - Message broker that facilitates communication between various application components through asynchronous messaging.

## Networking

- **Route 53 Hosted Zone**:
    
    - Manages DNS resolution for the application, allowing users to access the application via friendly domain names.
- **Internet Gateway**:
    
    - Provides a route for traffic between the VPC and the internet, enabling public subnet resources to communicate with users.

## Security

- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**:
    
    - Protects the application from common web exploits and malicious traffic, enhancing security.
- **SSL/TLS Certificate (ACM)**:
    
    - Ensures encrypted data transmission between clients and the application, safeguarding user data.
- **Security Groups**:
    
    - Acts as virtual firewalls for the Tomcat instances and backend services, controlling inbound and outbound traffic based on defined rules.

## Conclusion

This architecture effectively addresses the requirements for deploying a Java application on AWS with a lift-and-shift approach. It prioritizes scalability, high availability, and security while leveraging AWS services to create a robust infrastructure. This design can be adapted and expanded based on future needs, ensuring the application can grow with its user base.
